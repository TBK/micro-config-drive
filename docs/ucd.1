       [1mucd [22m[OPTIONS...]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mucd  [22mruns at boot time with the purpose of configuring a cloud instance
       for use of the end user.

       ucd can perform any of the following (optional) tasks:

       +o   create a default account with sudo privileges

       +o   lock root and default account, the only way to login is  using  ssh
           keys (security feature)

       +o   maintain the cloud instance in a right state (resize/fix partitions
           and filesystem)

       +o   get and process userdata and metadata from an attached config-drive
           block device



       Userdata formats supported:

       +o   [1mcloud-config[22m: begins with [1m#cloud-config [22mand is used to execute cer-
           tain tasks in a human friendly format

       +o   [1mshell-script[22m: begins with [1m#! [22mand is used to execute a shell script



       Metadata formats supported:

       +o   [1mopenstack[0m



[1mOPENSTACK DATASOURCES[0m
       Datasources are used to retrive instance-specific data in order to con-
       figure  a new cloud instance. Openstack attaches two datasources to the
       cloud instance when it boots.

       +o   [1mconfig-drive[22m: is a disk formatted with vfat or iso9660 and  have  a
           label of config-2

       +o   [1mmetadata    service[22m:    instances    can    access    to    it   at
           http://169.254.169.254 [1m[NOT SUPPORTED][0m



       more information about openstack datasources can be found in:
