[1mNAME[0m
       [1mcloud-config [22m- User data format used by [1mucd(1)[0m

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1muser-data[0m

       [1m#cloud-config[0m

       cloud-config  data  is  provided by the cloud infrastructure to a cloud
       instance. This data is parsed by [1mcloud-init(1)  [22mwhich  then  configures
       the cloud instance based on the information in the cloud-config.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The user-data as provided can be of several formats. [1mcloud-init(1) [22msup-
       ports the [1mcloud-config [22mformat, but also supports generic shell scripts.
       If  the user-data starts with [1m#![22m, it is assumed that the user-data is a
       generic shell script, and [1mcloud-init [22mwill attempt to execute  the  data
       as  a script. If the user-data starts with the [1m#cloud-config [22mstanza, it
       is assumed the user-data  is  in  the  [1mcloud-config  [22mformat,  described
       below.

       The  [1mcloud-config  [22mformat  is used to structure configuration data pro-
       vided to the cloud instance. This data is structured in the YAML format
       ([1mhttp://yaml.org[22m).  Note  that  [1mcloud-init[22m(1) uses the libyaml library,
       which supports YAML version 1.1.

       In the YAML content, the root node (the document) contains  a  sequence
       of  directives.  These directives inform cloud-init that the content of
       the directive are processed by a directive-specific handler,  or  "mod-
       ule".

       cloud-init  includes  many  modules, each expecting a specifically con-
       structed content. This document lists the correct format and  organiza-
       tion  of  each  data section for the supported modules, describes their
       effect, and states various parameters for each option.

       Table  of  implemented  directives.  Column  3  ("Ref")  and  column  4
       ("CoreOS")  list  whether  the  reference  specification  or the CoreOS
       implementation  support  these  directives.  Note  that  implementation
       details may differ, due to the underlying differences in Operating Sys-
       tems.
